# Horiseon-Challenge
Module 1 Assignment

## Description
This project was to practice refactoring HTML and CSS to create a more logical and semantic format.  Additionally, accessiblity features were added. 

Solving the problems of this project taught me to understand better the relationships between inheritance in CSS, as well as the semantic organization for tidier HTML code.
